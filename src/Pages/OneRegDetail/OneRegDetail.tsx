                  After building the <a href="https://auspost.com.au/auth/invite" target="_blank">new AusPost registration app</a>, a complete rethink of how customers create an account, we needed a bold way to announce and reveal the new customer journey.

                <p>
                  Inspired by similar perspective and 3D-esque interface reveal videos (such as those by Apple), I wanted to give it a go myself.
                  Created entirely in Adobe After Effects having never used the software before, I worked on this reveal video for over 6 weeks, usually at night after work.
                  My deadline was our end-of-year showcase in mid-December, 2018.

                  The bulk of the work was recreating each interface element directly in After Effects.
                  As you can imagine, this was not a simple task as After Effects is not a prototyping application.
                  Less than a week before the showcase, I added the multiple 3D cameras used to provide the different camera angles seen in the video.
                  The music had to be epic too, in this case a shortened version of The Reveal by David Bruggemann.

                  Making the video was certainly a challenge, more time-consuming than I had originally imagined, but an achievable one nonetheless. The video was very well received both internally and externally.
