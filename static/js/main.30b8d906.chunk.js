But even React on its own wasn\u2019t enough, and I was feeling adventurous. I wanted to try a bunch of new technologies and really learn as much as I could during this time. Let\u2019s try server-side rendering. Let\u2019s have an easy-to-use test environment. Now if you\u2019ve ever looked into server-side rendering with React you\u2019d know it\u2019s not exactly trivial without some kind of framework."),n.createElement("p",null,"Enter Next.js, a React framework that makes server-side rendering easy and even has a built-in router. With support for TypeScript and Sass too, all that was needed was a simple config file and away we went. Oh and you declare your site\u2019s routes in the same config file as your plugins \u2014 weird flex, but ok. After sorting that out, a new question arose \u2014 how would we host the site? Well, with Next comes Now, and if that sentence makes no sense whatsoever then welcome to the world of web development. (",n.createElement("i",null,"Unfortunately for that joke, Now has been renamed Vercel. Fortunately it is much easier to google...now"),"). Vercel (previously Now) gives us serverless deployments that make deploying the fun part rather than the wait-ten-minutes-and-hope-it-worked part. Deployments take seconds, unique URLs generated with each change that live as long as you\u2019d like them to. With Next.js, each page gets its own serverless lambda with benefits ranging from improved SEO to quicker time-to-interaction. Getting it all up and running was as easy as another config file, complicated only by a bug with Next/Vercel (that thankfully had a workaround and was fixed a couple of weeks later), and by my complete lack of understanding of how Cloudflare worked. And yes I may have taken the site offline for a whole hour as I was trying to migrate the domain across and get DNS working correctly.

There\u2019s the homepage and a few smaller pages. The sponsorship mini-site that was previously in a separate repository had been React-ified and now lived with the rest of the site. Sponsor data (name, tier, image) is all loaded through a JSON file to reduce coupling and make updating even simpler. Similarly, the dynamic schedule component, built only in the week leading up to the hackathon, receives its data exclusively from a JSON file."),n.createElement("p",null,"A live, real-time schedule was the first feature on the original sketch and seeing it being used during the hackathon weekend (after a couple of bug fixes) was incredibly rewarding. The bugs that needed fixing were interesting, a direct result of one of the decisions I had made earlier \u2014 to go server-rendered. When loading the site, it would check the current time and work out which event to display as \u2018active\u2019 on the schedule. As the site was hosted and rendered on a server in San Francisco, the \u2018current time\u2019 was not in fact the current time of the user viewing the site, but rather that of the server halfway across the world. So at 9:30 am on Saturday March 16 when the first event in the schedule was supposed to go from the white \u2018future\u2019 state to the yellow \u2018active\u2019 state and nothing happened, needless to say I was a bit confused."),n.createElement("p",null,"\u201cBut it works on my machine\u201d echoed across the organisers room multiple times that day. Later that night when I realised the issue I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Good old timezones. After trying many different solutions I realised I was over-complicating it. A simple update to the schedule data to include Melbourne\u2019s timezone and a minor update to the code and everything was working once again, thankfully on machines other than my own. Fun fact: about a month later, a Sydney region was added to Now, allowing the site to be deployed and rendered on a server that wouldn\u2019t have exhibited this issue. But I\u2019m glad for the issue, without it I wouldn\u2019t have learned to think about the possible side-effects of server rendering.
